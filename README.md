# Cracking-Machine-Learning-Interview

The purpose of this repo is two fold:

* To help meslef and you prepare for data scienentist/ML engineer/DL engineer related interviews
* To summarize machine learning related knowledge in the form of easy to review Q&A

Most of the content are summarized from online resources including books, lectures, lecture notes, past exam. I would love to continously maintain and update this repo. Most of the answers are come from the original questions but some of them are added by myself. So consume with your own judgement and any correction/suggestions are welcome.

Any pull request are welcome.
